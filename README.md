# Data Structures Framework and Algorithm Design (Incomplete)

This project focuses on the development and implementation of a comprehensive framework for data structures and algorithm design. It aims to provide clear, efficient, and reusable code for fundamental data structures, as well as practical examples of algorithmic techniques. The goal is to support learning, experimentation, and application of core computer science concepts in data organization and problem-solving.

## **Project Structure**

The repository is organized into the following components:

- **`1 Heaps` Folder**:   
  This folder contains the theoretical framework and explanations for Heaps (Max Heap and Min Heap) data structure.

- **`2 Stacks` Folder**:
  This folder contains the theoretical framework and explanations for Stacks data structure.

- **`3 Queues` Folder**:
  This folder contains the theoretical framework and explanations for Queues data structure.

- **`4 Singly Linked List` Folder**:  
  This folder contains the theoretical framework and explanations for Singly Linked Lists data structure.

- **`project_data_structures.py` Python Script**:   
  This Python script includes all the data structures developed specifically for this project.

- **`requirements.txt` Text File**:   
  This file lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

## **Final Note**

The system developed for this project was created solely for academic purposes. It is not designed to be an optimal or production-grade benchmarking tool.
